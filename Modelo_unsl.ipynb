       " 'my first fully custom adventure tldr  my first fully custom session thought  was under prepared turned out to be  decent  and over prepared because my party loves to  and plan alright so    couple times before  run death house for my old dm and some friends  couple sessions of  of fury from  from the  portal and death house again for my current party last night   my first fully custom session  couple members of our party are gone for  few weeks because of christmas so  offered to run death house and then some custom stuff for  couple sessions after this is letting our normal dm play and sometimes  just wanna have everything  under the rules  like   know if  can keep it up forever but for  few weeks at  time it seems super  especially because we have  bunch of role players without the book and story points to hit  really get to just let the party have their  and make their crazy decisions and because next weeks content  exist  really no harm setting  wanted to focus on  and as  result  on   town from there  figured  gotta have an empire for that to work so  an empire too on the  to move beyond that  used   form for creating  local area as seen in weblink from there  tried to figured out why my empire goes to new places at which point   on  what they do they are always  and looking to set up  they can when  got to the portion about gods  really wanted people to    storm as their main god and came up with  loose background for how that came to be but  save that in case my party is reading long story short we start on  ship   out to the  and on the way is  massive storm wall    of some kind covered in  stands on the bow while the party and some  are tied to   that  have  the storm  around them as   and  of their crimes the storm parts and they exit into what seems to be an entirely different ocean as  now   climate the empire  into the storm wall regularly and where it takes them is where they should be the party the group seemed pretty excited to play plenty of different characters but in the end they  on the following  young   out to become the king of his  and   great defeat it  in the past   fire    being born in his area is rare and seen as  sign of good  and    street  picked up by the empire for assumed  and who eventually figured  at least be in control of his own fate out in the       are  as an  to every  because if  going to go down the  always gets out and is able to report  human  from  powerful family that  the empire with the best  and beer around his   is almost entirely  soul  including him and his  brother while   they are  competitive with each other and  gone to the  to prove   hero and running  whole  is   possibility finally we have our red  criminal     and magic users are  with  here there are no  and the rest of the  that are left are the  evil burn down your town and steal your shit kinda  as such  are  with   and  are part of the empire as  whole but the rest are assumed to be  often  in them actually becoming    generally friendly guy who hates the empire because they want to control everything  not actually true about the empire but it would definitely feel that way to    so  love it an   woman with only one hand she signed up for the  for unknown reasons and the players  sure why yet because    she seems to be  and willing to help and clearly knows some kind of magic as she now has her hand back in  nice  the players assume this to be   hand which could definitely be true the adventure after getting to the town   up pretty fast and sent out to look into the most recent problem their stuff has been missing weapons   basically anything metal the last party went out but only number came back and he  to his  on the way back being found on the  of town  had prepared  custom  adventure focusing mostly on local monsters and   city    find the  be attacked by some  and go looking for the other members of the party and the missing goods  did not plan for our  very    trying to take over the  off the  from the first encounter right off the  after they find the tree with  couple    and  secret  they start trying to  the  run into their  and the  follows them in  pretty  to side with him until he brings the others in to get killed so the  leaves and tries to convince everyone that the   evil and that they should come in and help him convince them to storm the town eventually our   is tired of all the talking  into the  and  sleep in there  roll the sleep and she score number putting number of the number  to sleep the rest notice her and number try to chase her while another runs off to get help she  into the tall grass and the party has to fight  couple  some combat  and they kill the number  now they enter into the next room with just number  right as   up they talk to them  bit and eventually the  explain that  another  in charge of them and he looks just like the  literally my planned leader of this was  red   and of course one of my players picks that too lol they ask about the leader and the  tell them that their leader killed  lot of the  to take over the party or the  specifically says  kill him and take over instead the  are pretty  to that but really scared of the leader so they just let the party past telling them about the  and drawing   map they mention  need to bring food for the snake the party is concerned the other  will attack them so the   leader     named  with them when  getting close to the next area an  lake with   near some  that leads to the other side   them about the snake saying they need to bring some meat or  to  in the water if they notice them this was intended to be  pretty easy to pass  encounter but the party says  kill the snake and our  runs into the water  roll  dice to see if the snake is in the area and roll number the snake immediately  the party gets number round to move away and the snake rolls highest  coming up and immediately eating the entire  of meat that the  have to feed it when they cross then it  the party and looks like  going to attack this is  giant  snake   number monster with only  but whos average damage is number more than either  max hp the  chaos  it for number force damage then the       op at level number is and deals number damage between the mark and his   actually pretty hurt the  fire  it for number damage the   it for number and it attacks the closest person the  it  another round of damage and this thing is on  last legs then it  again the  kills it with his  and they cut off one of   we end the session there because at this point  been about number hours that was the second room of my like number room  the party was having  lot of fun talking with people on the boat at the start then in the town then with each other and the  woman we got into the  after like number hours first hour was  characters and talking about the world  thought  was   because   really thought out any of the  basically just  some  here   trap in this hall   giant snake in the lake  just assumed the mm had  tough snake and it turned out to be  at level number  seem to matter though because that party had  lot of fun just role playing and got to end it off on   fight where they  felt  die if this thing hit them  made up almost all of my  on the spot  knew there was    guard captain and that one of the other  members was the one  woman everyone they  with was  and went well  am looking forward to our next session  made what  think is  decent map maybe  post my little adventure to  dm subreddit',\n",

argument please  assume it is the only argument  christian can make   be honest this is something  struggle with understanding so   pretend to have all the answers still  couple  important things to realize the  were seriously bad news by  standards it was part of their religious  to sacrifice children  number number  number  bunch of others plus  bunch of other evil crap if you put any stock in god being just or   then these guys had   coming their way god knew all of that and  set the  against them as  this is somewhat obvious because god clearly knows everything but  number  it they were given  time to turn from their evil ways and they  they  killed for being in the wrong place at the wrong time they were killed because they had had an  coming for  long while these crimes were cultural  so most people had committed them personally and the rest were  generally   strong theme in the bible that doing nothing while evil  does not excuse you from  going before the lord and saying hey  never   son because we were in the middle of    just stood by and did nothing while half my  did is gonna get you zero  culture is  and once   it  tend to go away  not even   thing anyone can look at the world and see  true if the  had stuck around their culture would have stuck around as well and it would have  the children of israel god  says this in  number as for the children  not sure what to tell you because there are  lot of  ideas about an age of  that  not  in one thing  know is that babies and children are not innocent or pure of sin they  little  until they first lie or  somebody  not how it works in  number david says he was  in sin brought forth in  and that guy was  man after  own heart or hey just look at any children you know  not like parents have to sit their kids down and  them in how to be  or  or how to steal and fight that stuff comes naturally to them as it comes naturally to all people it makes sense when you think about it kids happen when two parents come together to share  part of themselves right so two tall people have tall kids two black people have black kids two intelligent people will probably have intelligent kids    so you can do the math on what happens when two  have  child following from that this is an age before jesus and the hope of  the  of sin is death always and everybody was under  back then including the  as you pointed out whether death comes from   sword or  heart attack at age number the  were still going to have to answer for everything  done large and small in the next life basically the lord  and the lord  away but yeah  not entirely sure about that subject either still  hope  gave you some context if nothing else the rest of your  are easier and seem to come from   about the bible or the nature of god no offense  god does not have competition anymore than  wife has competition would you call  wife  for being angry when her husband started sleeping around  is for people who have no right to or claim over something they feel  too  to say the lord god  has  right to and claim over everything and everyone because they are his obviously this is even more true for the  who had    with him and had their  saved more times than anyone can remember on   note god does not have competition  hate to break it to the  but their beliefs are  with  jesus  say  am  way  truth and  life he said  am the way the truth and the life every other god is  false god stealing what   to god and  mean literally stealing satan has   job trying to screw humanity over and god actively  him from getting what he wants obviously  is  with  as well god is actively involved in everything that happens on the earth he  it and  it and us even more so  one   thinking of but   remember it right now try  number  number job number or  number so when the  have an awesome  or win  great victory and go and   for it they are ignoring the guy who actually  them with    or  their enemies to them in favor of  the guy who was actively working to  their  and kill their soldiers that seem fair to you they are  satan or one of his dogs for trying to doom them in every way while  on the god who  them every single day in ways large and small so yeah you could say god is feeling  little   basically the same as above god  being  like   ex who posts your  pictures all over the   just giving israel what they want if they  on his name and break his  then well it looks like they  want his  or protection  not   just actions having consequences the  could not take  in  fight without  help and sure enough when he  to their  and left them alone they got  he  them after  while when they  out to him and obviously kept them safe while in  ie  like all people they were real  on having   not so much on having  master as for less  that question is kind of above my pay grade and  need to read the specific circumstances again besides the rain falls on the just and   now god is  in that revenge is his  him but that  what happened in the example you  and  also not what  thinking of   is just and holy and deserved and he never  again  not crazy ex  live by the sword die by the sword  what you      draw   between the bible and the people in the bible there  many strong independent  that  need no man in the bible but there  many in the history books either  not at fault for our own  essentially also keep in mind that life was different back then in an extremely real and concrete and not at all  way   know what  school you went to but they  very good at their job if they taught you women are the reason we live in  fallen world  mean  no  basis for that you can crack open  yourself and see sure  was stupid and  but so was adam hell they were even standing together at the time    weak or whatever she was just the one the  spoke to first now adam totally said he was  by his stupid and  woman but that says everything about him and nothing about god yeah only men were allowed to serve at the  and only men are allowed to be  or  today  because god gave men  certain level of  authority he did not give to women   that for  or  or whatever  just responsibility keep in mind the idea that women and men are number the same in every  way has no like actual proof to support it we   nature from  so we just all kind of choose to believe that because it means we  have to fight over it   authority  something you can measure or test for and  assume if someone was going to know about it one way or the other it would be god so here we are   my time and  got  test tomorrow but  happy  got the chance to reply to you please let me know your thoughts  hope  explained everything  ',\n",

       " 'crazy theory about  crying child well  been watching lots of your videos about   recently and in one of them you mentioned something no one talks about even you  dig up that much on this and for me it could be something important the fact is the  in  purple suit saying again and again that the baby  mine when we see the show  obvious that the baby is his baby but this show could just be  excuse to repeat to us this sentence by  purple guy back in the day people thought and you said it on that video  mentioned that he probably was talking about michael because of the things written on the security  if  was talking to michael then the do you remember your name and  like that pointed that michael had  or something similar and could be that the baby  mine but your last golden  video  that  here  ask who is the only character that we do relatively know is the closest to be  baby crying child who is the only one of  children if we  michael  everything correctly and says to  he is going to find him  to him as father after  his sister crying child what about if crying child is not  son what about if purple guy is just using this kid maybe an  or something like that to  with him  his room not for his safety because he is his son but to keep an eye on his  for example with his   that could explain why is purple guy so mean to him not as   father but as  an angry  or crazy man that  his  several times as we see in the midnight   he  sound like  father trying yo protect his child he is  crazy guy who loses his toy now and then another thing that  me is that if we discount that he  in the his house there is no other fact that points crying child to be  son and  brother but michael did say the word father where we  is talking about   know  said something similar  couple of  before and the point of that game was find his sister getting to his  location  know that the name could be saying that  baby is just  sister location of  but  think scott wanted to make that play on words if we   am correct we still have the  me quote but this could be explain the way it was explained before people started  that crying child in the golden  suit was talking to his brother in fact he is talking to his  maybe to  him maybe with   will or just as  warning  he is  peaceful spirit and that he  his death as  accident trying to  michael about the  state and my last point of this theory is in the   story we think that  family is  mirror of the  family being  some  of michael and crying child but what about if the  family are number people and always have been like their mirror family in   yes  know  at some people eyes is more similar to crying child but  by the things that happen to him but in personality he is like michael all this  came to my mind when  figured out that quote from the purple suit  being sister location what  think of like  game to understand   as well to  new story as scott says he makes no  and  purple  guy saying that this baby  mine  times during the game  sound to me like  random quote if it was why is that tv show all about  make sense well thanks to everyone who spent his time reading my theory sorry if my english went  at some time and if  missed something that  breaks my theory  new in this world or nightmare xd that is   and   even read the books yet so  here to learn and talk about anything and remember this is just  theory  game theory',\n",
